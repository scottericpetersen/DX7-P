# Analysis folder

This directory is where the program will write analysis files. Those files will contain analysis, a SynthDef to generate pitch and amplitude LFO data, and the DX7 sound-generating SynthDef. To use the SynthDefs in your own projects, see the example.scd document in the root directory.
